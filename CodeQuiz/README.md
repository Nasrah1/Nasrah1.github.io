In this folder I have created 2 HTML files (index.html and end.html)
I have also created 2 JavaScript files and one style.css for all the files combined.
Most of my code is inside my index.html file which containes most of my classes and un-order list.
In my index.html file i've included a <a href> tag of my end.html page.
I've included several syntax and some pseudocodes to help with my code.
