In this assignment i created a BurgerApp that is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers theyâ€™d like to eat

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM.

I also deployed my app to Heroku for web hosting.

I used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and I used Handlebars to generate HTML.
